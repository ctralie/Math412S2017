# Math412S2017
Code for John's students for delay reconstruction and fast Rips code with "Ripser" (courtesy of Uli Bauer)

# Installation Instructions

To run this code, you will need to checkout and compile Ripser.  First, run the following command

~~~~~ bash
git checkout --recursive https://github.com/ctralie/Math412S2017.git
~~~~~

Then, go into the ``ripser'' directory, and type the following

~~~~~ bash
make ripser
make ripser-coeff
~~~~~

Now you should be able to run all of the examples:

* TDA.py: Code to compute persistent homology (basic command line wrapper around ripser, with functions to plot diagrams)

* SlidingWindow.py: Code to compute sliding window embeddings of 1D signals, with an example of cos(t) + cos(pi t), reporting persistent H1 and H2.  Also shows how to compute PCA

* HorseWhinnies.py: Quantifying periodicity and quasiperiodicity of snippets of audio from "horsewhinnie.wav"

* MusicSpeech.py: Running TDA on audio novelty functions to discover rhythmic periodicity in music.  Comparing journey.wav to speech.wav

* MusicFeatures.py: Quick and dirty music feature computation (MFCC, audio novelty functions) from spectrograms

* VideoTools.py: Code for doing sliding window videos

* testVideo.py: Code for testing sliding window videos

* RipsFiltrationDM.m: A Matlab wrapper around ripser over distance matrices

* RipsFiltrationPC.m: A Matlab wrapper around ripser over point clouds

* plotpersistencediagrams.m: A function to plot all persistence diagrams on top of each other

* TorusExample: An Matlab example of persistent H0, H1, and H2 on a sampled torus

# Persistence Diagram Matching Tools

There is also Python code to compare persistence diagrams using a variety of algorithms (DGMTools.py).  To compute the Wasserstein Distance, you will need to install a library that implements the Hungarian algorithm for maximum flow bipartite matching.  To do this, type

~~~~~ bash
pip install hungarian
~~~~~
